Activity diagrams are to behavioral diagrams the same as class diagrams to structural ones. It shows the workflow of a client's decisions, showing all the possible outcomes. It's composed by these elements: Initial state or start point, Activity/action state, action flow, decisions and branching, guards, final state or end points, and swim lanes.

* Initial state: represented by a circle, indicastes how the system begins.

* Activity or the action state. This is a pretty significant portion of an activity diagram, each box is an activity or it is a state. Another syntax, depending on the UML tool that you're using, will have rounded edges for each of these states.

* Action flow. In the Action state above, they're represented by arrows.

* Decisions / branching and Guards: Represented by diamonds, a decision has to be made here. The guards are the decisions to made.

* Final state or endpoint: Represented by a circle with a black circle inside.

* Swim lane: Organizes activities. In the example, we have a quiz that is the activity diagram, inside of that we have swim lanes. In this case, we have a teacher, system, and student.

This represents a way of organizing each of the activities

* we know when a teacher should be for performing a task
* when a system/server should be performing a task
* when a student should be performing a task
