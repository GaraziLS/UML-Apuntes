They show everything that a user has access to (won't be the same for regular users and game developers for example, because game devs will have access to the code while regular users won't). It's composed by use cases, actors, subsystems, and relationships.

* *** Use cases ***: Use Cases are represented by a circle and typically have some type of action. This is something that is very important when it comes to building these types of diagrams, we're trying to illustrate what types of actions and functionalities that an actor has access to, without worrying about classes or other more detailed things.

* *** Actors ***: Or user types. Players vs game devs, for example. Or clients and store owners. But a user can also be an API client.
* *** Subsystems ***: Represented by large rectangular boxes inside use case diagrams (see diagram above)
* *** Relationships ***: Relationships are represented by dotted lines with open arrows. This shows how you can go from one use case to another use case. This gives you the ability to connect your actors directly to the use cases and to the elements and actions that they have access to in the system.
